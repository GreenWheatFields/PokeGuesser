# PokeGuesser

A Pokemon guessing game built on PokeAPI.

This is my first real Java project, it came from me messing around with API'S.

Uses Google's gson to parse API data and jsoup to scrap wiki data


Right now the game is a cmd game, I will learn how to build a GUI to make it better

Currently I am working on getting an abundance of features into the cmd version, so the GUI will be easier to create.

To play, just run the jar from your cmd.
