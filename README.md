# PokeGuesser

A Pokemon guessing game built on PokeAPI.

This is my first Java project, it came from me messing around with API'S.
Uses Google's gson to parse API data


Roadmap
[ ] Get the backend stable and consistent. 
[ ] Learn to create a GUI to display the actual game (Will be a cmd game first, then GUI)
[ ] Learn how to import list of all pokemon for use as typo suggestion.
[ ] Learn a language that handles http request and json data better than Java.
