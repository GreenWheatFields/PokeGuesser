TODO LIST;

[x] fix bug where the main class isn't recognized
[x] get and assign applicable variables from JSON data // still need generation data, and color // pokeAPI doesnt have color
[x] fix big where pokemon with a single type cannot be checked for a second type without nullpointer
[x] Add dialogue to testConn method. Also add response to an HTTP response of 0;
[x] Add method to disconnect connection, maybe this will make it easier to get random pokemon. either way, the way a connection is opened will need to be optimized.
[x] figure out how to get a random pokemon whenever i need a new pokemon. I think i can do it by adding randomePoke and pokeURL to their own method and calling it. not sure, will focus on the basic first
[x] create introductory dialogue for the game.
[x] rename classes // general cleanup
[x] Parse JSON data for pokemon front/back sprites
[x] Merge test classes into main class.
[x] Consistently get sprites urls from bulbapedia
[x] figure out how to "find and replace" pokemons name from the scrapped bublapedia data
[x] See if PokeAPI has 'generation first introduced'
[ ] Learn how to make a GUI
[ ] Learn how to download images linked in API and display them in the GUI
[ ] Finish cmd version
[x] Handle problem pokemon and how they interact with bublbapedia
[ ] Suppress deprecated warning
[ ] typo detection, game modes, timer
[x] change x/y in firstGens to x and y
[ ] make random pokemon non-repeating
[x] remove back sprites, as they are inconsistent in PokeAPI, and not as useful as front sprites
[ ] figure out how to pass through generation ranges into randomPoke variable
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
KNOWN BUGS
[x]Unnecessarily checks https response every time a new Pokemon is generated
[ ]"Pokemon" is inconsistent with the accented e.
[x] when user inputs 'reveal' it also shows that as an incorrect answer. not sure if i want that.
[ ] hitting enter without typing anything results in an incorrect guess.
[x] pokeAPI only has game indices up to #649, possible fix: all pokemon from 650 to 721 first appear in x and y 721 to 807 first appear in sun/moon
[ ] pokemon above 649 do not have all sprites on pokeAPI. only  front, although some pokemon around #800 have neither, could use https://pokemondb.net/sprites for those
